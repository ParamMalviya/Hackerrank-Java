# HackerRank Java Solutions (Easy Level)

This repository contains solutions to the easy-level questions from [HackerRank's Java domain](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java?badge_type=java). These challenges cover a wide range of Java fundamentals, and solving them will help you improve your understanding of the language.

## üìÇ Directory Overview

The `Java(Easy)` directory contains solutions categorized by different Java topics, including:

1. **Introduction**: 
   - Getting started with basic Java syntax and output.
   - Examples: *Welcome to Java*, *Java Stdin and Stdout I*, *Java If-Else*.

2. **Strings**:
   - Challenges that involve manipulating and formatting strings.
   - Examples: *Java Strings Introduction*, *Java Substring*, *Java Anagrams*.

3. **Data Types**:
   - Understanding and working with various Java data types.
   - Examples: *Java Datatypes*, *Java Int to String*.

4. **Loops**:
   - Problems that require repeated operations using loops.
   - Examples: *Java Loops I*, *Java Loops II*.

5. **Conditionals**:
   - Challenges to implement conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, and `switch`.
   - Examples: *Java If-Else*, *Java Switch*.

6. **Arrays**:
   - Working with single and multi-dimensional arrays.
   - Examples: *Java 1D Array*, *Java 2D Array*.

7. **Date and Time**:
   - Problems involving the `LocalDate` class and working with dates in Java.
   - Examples: *Java Date and Time*.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Challenges that help understand Java's OOP features like classes and inheritance.
   - Examples: *Java Inheritance*, *Java Abstract Class*.

9. **Exception Handling**:
   - Learning how to handle errors and exceptions in Java.
   - Examples: *Java Exception Handling (Try-catch)*.

10. **Advanced Topics** (Easy Level):
    - Introduction to slightly advanced concepts like static initialization blocks.
    - Examples: *Java Static Initializer Block*.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Java
- **Compiler**: Java Development Kit (JDK) ‚Äì You can use any version that supports the features used in the challenges.
- **IDE**: You can use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, or any code editor of your choice.

## üöÄ How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ParamMalviya/Hackerrank-Java.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `Java(Easy)` directory:
   ```
   cd Hackerrank-Java/Java(Easy)
   ```
3. Compile and run a Java file:
   ```
