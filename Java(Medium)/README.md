# HackerRank Java Solutions (Medium Level)

This repository contains solutions to the medium-level questions from [HackerRank's Java domain](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java?badge_type=java&filters%5Bdifficulty%5D%5B%5D=medium). These challenges require a deeper understanding of Java and introduce more complex programming concepts, making them ideal for those looking to advance their skills.

## üìÇ Directory Overview

The `Java(Medium)` directory contains solutions organized by different Java topics, including:

### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Challenges focusing on concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
   - Examples: *Java Abstract Class*, *Java Method Overriding II*.

### 2. **Data Structures**
   - Implementing and working with data structures like lists, stacks, and maps.
   - Examples: *Java Hashset*, *Java Dequeue*, *Java Priority Queue*.

### 3. **Algorithm Implementation**
   - Medium-level problems involving sorting, searching, and other algorithmic solutions.
   - Examples: *Java Comparator*, *Java Subarray*.

### 4. **Advanced Loops & Conditionals**
   - More complex use cases involving nested loops, conditionals, and decision-making.
   - Examples: *Java Regex 2 - Duplicate Words*, *Tag Content Extractor*.

### 5. **String Manipulation**
   - Intermediate-level string problems involving pattern matching, regex, and parsing.
   - Examples: *Java Regex*, *Valid Username Regular Expression*.

### 6. **Exception Handling**
   - Challenges that require advanced understanding of error handling and custom exceptions.
   - Examples: *Java Exception Handling*, *Java Exception Handling (Advanced)*.

### 7. **Collections and Generics**
   - Problems that explore the Java Collections framework and the use of generics.
   - Examples: *Java Generics*, *Java BitSet*.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Java
- **Compiler**: Java Development Kit (JDK) ‚Äì Recommended version 8 or later.
- **IDE**: Use any code editor, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParamMalviya/Hackerrank-Java.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `Java(Medium)` directory:
   ```bash
